The Architect
=============


In the Matrix the Architect was a highly specialized, humorless program of the
machine world as well as the creator of the Matrix. As the chief administrator
of the system, he is possibly a collective manifestation, or at the very least
a virtual representation of the entire Machine mainframe.

In our own reality the Architect is service modeling and management program.
It's used by humans to create virtual representations of software services and
allow control thier entire life cycles.


Inventory
=========

Inventory is the Architect's metadata engine. It encapsulates and unifies data
from various metadata sources to provide inventory/metadata for various
orchestration services.
